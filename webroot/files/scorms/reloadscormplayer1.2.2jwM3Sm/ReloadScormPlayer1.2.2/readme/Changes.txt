Changes for 1.2.1
-----------------
* Added a command argument handler so that users can set system properties. This is useful for network 
  users who are getting wrong "user.home" settings.
  Create a shortcut or batch file or script file pointing to the application  (or edit the existing one)
  and append an argument to the target such as:
      "C:\Program Files\Reload Tools\ScormPlayer\ReloadSCORMPlayer.exe" user.home=mydir
  or
      ReloadSCORMPlayer.exe user.home=\\APath\shared
  or if running the jar:
      reload-scorm-player.jar user.home=//appath/mydir<br>
  If there are spaces in the path, surround the argument with quotes: 
      "user.home=d:\some dir"
      
* Fixed problem where if a browser window playing package A was left open while the management
  interface launched package B - the player would still show Package A.
  This only occured if the browser window was left open between playing different packages.


Changes for 1.2

* Content is updated using an apache struts behind the scenes.
* Tree widget now correct way up in Safari (MacOs X)

Changes for v1.1
----------------
* Fixed known issues -
	Browsers - Windows
		Netscape 7+	- "quit" button now unloads sco and loads a different page.
		IE 6 - "quit" now unloads sco and loads a different page.
	Browsers - Mac OS X
		Netscape 7+ - "quit" button now unloads sco and loads a different page.
		IE 5.2 - "quit" button now unloads sco and loads a different page.
    General - In netscape and mozilla browsers, if a user clicked "quit" during a session, then
				that particular sco would not persist its datamodel.  
				This has now been addressed and should work in most browsers.
	CMI Datamodel - lesson_location being set to the URL of the sco, now removed, so that it
					is blank as per specs.		
	Submanifests - 	Fixed situation where if an item referenced a submanifest, the submanifest items did not appear.			
	
* New features
	Preferences now appear on MacOsX in correct location as they do on other Mac applications.
	An auto fix option in preferences to allow repair of user folder
	Ability	to toggle tree widget on/off in preferences
	Ability	to toggle navigation on/off in preferences
	Ability	to toggle auto progression on/off in preferences
		- auto progression allows the sequencing engine to automatically
			load in the next sco to be taken once the current sco has called LMSFinish
	Warning	given to user when they try to import a scorm resource package


Changes for v1.0.1
