The RELOAD SCORM Player is a Java application, and should run on any platform capable of running Java applications.  From the RELOAD web site, installation packages are available for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh (OSX only) platforms, with a binary package (.bin) available for Linux.  The install file for Windows includes a copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is installed under the RELOAD SCORM Player installation directory. This JRE (v1.4.2.04) should not interfere with other Java Virtual Machines installed elsewhere on your system. The Mac installer does not include a JVM, but utilises the system JVM. No JVM is included with the Linux package either. Instructions on the Reload Web Site explain how to obtain and install a JVM for Linux.</P>

<P>The information given here (and throughout these help files) pertain to the Microsoft Windows version of the SCORM Player.  Other versions should function in (almost) the same way - though they may look slightly different.</P><P>
