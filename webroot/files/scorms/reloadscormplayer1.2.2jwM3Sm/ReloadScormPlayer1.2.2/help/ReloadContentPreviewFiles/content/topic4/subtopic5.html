The Simple Sequencing specification faciltates the linking together of learning objects based on sequencing rules. This means that a specific route through a set of learning materials can be retained when it is moved from one LMS (Learning Management System) to another. Simple Sequencing is often seen as intermediate step towards the much more powerful facilities offered by Learning Design. In the short term though, Simple Sequencing will provide enough functionality for many users and its incorporation into SCORM v1.3 (in beta release as of 18/06/03) will ensure its widespread uptake. </p>
